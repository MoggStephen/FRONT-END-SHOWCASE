    <h1>Section - &lt;section&gt;</h1>
    <p>The section element defines a section within a document</p>
    <p>This is typically used within the body element.</p>
    <p>This is fairly similar to the main element however this element can be used as many times as needed.</p>
    <p>A section typically contains headings and paragraphs</p>
    <p>A section with no heading would not appear in the document outline. Creating a heading and making it hidden is how to solve it.</p>
    <p>Secondary navigation is sometimes included in a section element.</p>
