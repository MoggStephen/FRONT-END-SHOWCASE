        <summary>Navigating through website structure using href attribute</summary>

        <img src="0media/images/websiteStructure.png" style="height: 700px;">
        <p>As ive been coding my website ive been using the "./"" to navigate to my media folders to display images. This is a relative path. A relative path is one that starts from
            the current directory. For example the current directory of the audio.html file is "htmlElements\audioAndVideo". In order to get to the media folder 
            to display an image i would need to use the relative path "./media". This accesses the current relative directory to the "htmlElements\audioAndVideo" so that i can 
            access the media folder there. If i wanted to back a directory i would use "../" which would take me to the "htmlElements" directory.
        </p>
        <p>From here on out if i wanted to go back more than 1 directoriy the method to do this changes. To go back 2 directories which in this website takes us back to the root
            of the website the method to do this is "../../". From here on out adding one more "../" takes us one more directory back relatively. In this case doing "../../" does 
            take us to the root of the website however this is done relatively so it is not an absolute path.
        </p>
        <p>An absolute path always begins with "/" which accesses the root directory of the website. In the case of the website currently accessing the absolute path does 
            not work. This is because the website is not setup with a server and browsers dont know the root of the website as im simply opening the website via its html from
            its folder. In order to use an abosulte path and have it work i would need to run my website through a server which tells the browser what the root of the 
            website is. Using the absolute path in vs code brings up the root of the website however the browser doesnt know that and the browser takes us to root directory
            of the hard drive on my computer which is "file:///D:/". Running the website through a server should solve this.
        </p>
        <p>Ive just installed a live server extension which replicates a live environment for my website. Instead of simply opening my website through its html a live server and port is used.
            In doing so now the browser knows where the root directory of my website is and i can now use absolute paths. Additionally saving a page will automatically refresh
            the webpage open on my browser.

            <summary>Interaction between base element and relative and absolute paths.</summary>

            <p>As ive been updating my base element ive learnt some things. Supposedly the base element should only interact with relative paths however ive added what i thought was an 
                absolute path but the base element interacted with it. So ive learnt some things about the types of paths that there are:
            </p>
            <li>Relative paths -----------------------------> href="audio.html"   ||   href="./audio.html"   ||   href="../"   ||   href="../../" and so on</li>
            <li>A kind of absolute but still relative path -> href="/index.html"</li>
            <li>An absolute path ---------------------------> href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html"</li>
            <li>A local absolute path on your system -------> href="D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"   ||   href="file:///D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"</li>
            <p>So the base element interacts with the relative and kind of absolutes paths but not the absolute and local path. This means when a base is present we cant use a kind of
                absolute path as this will mess with the path but anytime else we can. We cannot use local paths whilst the website is live on a server.

        <summary>Emmet shortcuts</summary>
        <p>Emmet is an extension in vs code that has loads of shortcuts to speed up coding.</p>
        <p>When creating a new html file you can simply type "!" and then press tab to add all of the require boilerplate code for the webpage.</p>
        <p>When creating pretty much any element you can type the element without its angled brackets and press tab to create the element and set it up with its required attributes.</p>
        <p>When creating elements with the emmet shortcuts. You can type the elements ammet abbreviation and then add a "." which adds a class attribute to the element. Any words typed after will be the value of the class attribute. For example -> "p.content" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetClassExample.png">
        <p>This can be done for the id attribute as well with a "#". So typing the following -> "p#content2" creates the following:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetIdExample.png">
        <p>Typing these emmet abbreviations without an element beforehand emmet will defualt to creating a details element.</p>
        <p>to get more complex this can involve creating nested elements. Typing an element to be nested inside of an element uses ">". So creating a details inside of a details with the first details containing a class and the nested details containing an id would look like this: ".content>#id"</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetNestedExample.png">
        <p>To add multiple child elements you must use the "+" sign to add more nested elements inside the first. So -> ".content>#id+#id2" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetMultipleNestedExample.png">
        <p>Adding multiple of the same element can be done with the "*" symbol. So -> ".content>#id*3" creates: (This is mostly done with creating lots of list items)</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetMultipleSameNestedExample.png">
        <p>Lorem ipsum content can be created by typing "lorem" and then the nnumber of words you want. So -> "lorem20" creates:</p>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eveniet, repudiandae? Officiis distinctio sed quae quos itaque quis eveniet, mollitia neque.</p>
        <p>We can use parentheses to generate however many elements we want. So -> "(.content)*5" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetParenthesesGeneration.png">
        <p>When typing html emmet can be used to wrap the contents of the webpage so they fit onto the screen. This stops the need for halving the contents of any lines to fit onto the screen. This is done with "alt+z"</p>

        <summary>css- inline,internal and external</summary>
        <p>Using css to style a website there are multiple ways of adding css to elements.</p>
        <p style="color: brown;">The first is inline. Inline styling is done inside of the element using the style attribute. This obviously only affects that singular element so is used when styling something alone. Here is an example:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/inlineExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The second is internal. Internal sytling is done internally in a single webpage via a style element in the head element. This style element will hold styling for the whole page and specifies specific elements with associated styles. Here is an example:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/internalExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The third is external. External styling uses styling that is not visible on the webpage. A simple link element will be used linking to a css file outside of the webpage and styling will take place that way. Here is an example of the link and css stlye sheet:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/externalLinkExample.png" alt="">

        <summary>Favicons</summary>
        <p>Adding favicons into the website seems to be hard. Alot of the information out there says having the favicon in the root directory of your website seems to be the way, however from doing it this way it doesnt seem to work. Additionaly having it in an images folder in your root directory should be the way. Basically ive tried them all and some of them seem to work now and again. However what stays the same is the link element that you use to show the browser where to get the favicon from. The code should look like this: (with the correct location)</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/faviconExample.png" alt="">
        <p>Supposedly adding it in the root directory should make the website use the same favicon throughout all the webpages however this does not seem to be the case for me.</p>

        <summary>Block and inline</summary>
        <p>Elements work differently. There are 2 types of elements that work differently from each other. Span and details elements are most notably different. Span is an inline element meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much space that is neccessary for its content. Whereas a details element is a block element always starts on a new line and browsers always add some space (a margin) before and after the element. It always takes up the full width of the screen(It stretches out to the left and right as far as possible).</p>
        <ul>Block Level Elements:</ul>
        <img src="./0media/images/blockElements.png">
        <ul>Inline Elements:</ul>
        <img src="./0media/images/inlineElements.png" alt="">
        <p>The folowing shows the difference between the 2 types of elements with showing its border.</p>      
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">p</p>
        <span style="border: 1px solid black">span</span>
        <span style="border: 1px solid black">span</span>

        <summary>Importance of class and id attributes</summary>

        <p id="classBookmark"></p>
        <h2>Class:</h2>
        <p>The class attribute is used to specify a class for a HTML element. Multiple elements can share this class. Being able to refer to an elements class is often used to point to a style sheet. Importantly the elements with this class can be reffered to to be accessed and manipulated. Below shows the class of a paragraph element reffering internally to a style sheet.</p>
        <p class="randomClassStyle"> random class style text.</p>
        <p>This is the code:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/classStyleExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/classParagraphExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The class attribute can be used on any html element. It is case sensitive. The syntax for class has to be with a period "." then a name and curly braces with css in.</p>
        <p>In javascript to get a class attribute the syntax is -> "document.getElementsByClassName("classname")"</p>

        <br> 
    
        
        <h2>Id:</h2>
        <p>The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an html element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an html document, unlike class attributes whihc can be used as much as you like. Id is unique and only used once.</p>
        <p>The id attribute is most commonly used to point to a specific style declaration in a stylesheet. It is also used by javascript to manipulate that specific element.</p>
        <p>The syntax for id is to write a hash character "#" followed by and id name. Then define the css properties within the curly braces.</p>
        <p id="randomIdStyle"> random id style text</p>
        <p>This is the code:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/idStyleExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/idParagraphExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The id name must contain one character, it cannot start with a number and must not contain whitespaces.</p>
        <p>A use of id which class doesnt use is the ability to add html bookmarks and link to them. These bookmarks are placed throughout long documents and then a user can link to that bookmark in order to jump to that specific position in the document. Below is a link which should take you to the start of the class section:</p>
        <a href="#classBookmark">jump to bookmark</a>
        <p>This is coded like this:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/bookmarkExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/bookmarkExample2.png" alt="">
        <p>The id attributes is also used with javascript similarly to the class attribute where javascript can access elements with specific id's. This can then be handled and manipulated accordingly.</p>
        <p>The javascript syntax to get an id attribute is -> "document.getElementById("idname")"</p>
