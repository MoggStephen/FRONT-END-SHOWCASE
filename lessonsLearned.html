        <h3>Navigating through website structure using href attribute</h3>

        <p>As ive been coding my website ive been using the "./"" to navigate to my media folders to display images. This is a relative path. A relative path is one that starts from
            the current directory. For example the current directory of the audio.html file is "htmlElements\audioAndVideo". In order to get to the media folder 
            to display an image i would need to use the relative path "./media". This accesses the current relative directory to the "htmlElements\audioAndVideo" so that i can 
            access the media folder there. If i wanted to back a directory i would use "../" which would take me to the "htmlElements" directory.
        </p>
        <p>From here on out if i wanted to go back more than 1 directoriy the method to do this changes. To go back 2 directories which in this website takes us back to the root
            of the website the method to do this is "../../". From here on out adding one more "../" takes us one more directory back relatively. In this case doing "../../" does 
            take us to the root of the website however this is done relatively so it is not an absolute path.
        </p>
        <p>An absolute path always begins with "/" which accesses the root directory of the website. In the case of the website currently accessing the absolute path does 
            not work. This is because the website is not setup with a server and browsers dont know the root of the website as im simply opening the website via its html from
            its folder. In order to use an abosulte path and have it work i would need to run my website through a server which tells the browser what the root of the 
            website is. Using the absolute path in vs code brings up the root of the website however the browser doesnt know that and the browser takes us to root directory
            of the hard drive on my computer which is "file:///D:/". Running the website through a server should solve this.
        </p>
        <p>Ive just installed a live server extension which replicates a live environment for my website. Instead of simply opening my website through its html a live server and port is used.
            In doing so now the browser knows where the root directory of my website is and i can now use absolute paths. Additionally saving a page will automatically refresh
            the webpage open on my browser.

        <h3>Interaction between base element and relative and absolute paths.</h3>

        <p>As ive been updating my base element ive learnt some things. Supposedly the base element should only interact with relative paths however ive added what i thought was an 
            absolute path but the base element interacted with it. So ive learnt some things about the types of paths that there are:
        </p>
        <li>Relative paths -----------------------------> href="audio.html"   ||   href="./audio.html"   ||   href="../"   ||   href="../../" and so on</li>
        <li>A kind of absolute but still relative path -> href="/index.html"</li>
        <li>An absolute path ---------------------------> href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html"</li>
        <li>A local absolute path on your system -------> href="D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"   ||   href="file:///D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"</li>
        <p>So the base element interacts with the relative and kind of absolutes paths but not the absolute and local path. This means when a base is present we cant use a kind of
            absolute path as this will mess with the path but anytime else we can. We cannot use local paths whilst the website is live on a server.
