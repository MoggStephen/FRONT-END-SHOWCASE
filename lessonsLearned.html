        <summary>Navigating through website structure using href attribute</summary>

        <img src="0media/images/lessonsLearned/navigation/websiteStructure.png" style="height: 700px;">
        <p>As ive been coding my website ive been using the "./"" to navigate to my media folders to display images. This is a relative path. A relative path is one that starts from
            the current directory. For example the current directory of the audio.html file is "htmlElements\audioAndVideo". In order to get to the media folder 
            to display an image i would need to use the relative path "./media". This accesses the current relative directory to the "htmlElements\audioAndVideo" so that i can 
            access the media folder there. If i wanted to back a directory i would use "../" which would take me to the "htmlElements" directory.
        </p>
        <p>From here on out if i wanted to go back more than 1 directoriy the method to do this changes. To go back 2 directories which in this website takes us back to the root
            of the website the method to do this is "../../". From here on out adding one more "../" takes us one more directory back relatively. In this case doing "../../" does 
            take us to the root of the website however this is done relatively so it is not an absolute path.
        </p>
        <p>An absolute path always begins with "/" which accesses the root directory of the website. In the case of the website currently accessing the absolute path does 
            not work. This is because the website is not setup with a server and browsers dont know the root of the website as im simply opening the website via its html from
            its folder. In order to use an abosulte path and have it work i would need to run my website through a server which tells the browser what the root of the 
            website is. Using the absolute path in vs code brings up the root of the website however the browser doesnt know that and the browser takes us to root directory
            of the hard drive on my computer which is "file:///D:/". Running the website through a server should solve this.
        </p>
        <p>Ive just installed a live server extension which replicates a live environment for my website. Instead of simply opening my website through its html a live server and port is used.
            In doing so now the browser knows where the root directory of my website is and i can now use absolute paths. Additionally saving a page will automatically refresh
            the webpage open on my browser.

            <summary>Interaction between base element and relative and absolute paths.</summary>

            <p>As ive been updating my base element ive learnt some things. Supposedly the base element should only interact with relative paths however ive added what i thought was an 
                absolute path but the base element interacted with it. So ive learnt some things about the types of paths that there are:
            </p>
            <li>Relative paths -----------------------------> href="audio.html"   ||   href="./audio.html"   ||   href="../"   ||   href="../../" and so on</li>
            <li>A kind of absolute but still relative path -> href="/index.html"</li>
            <li>An absolute path ---------------------------> href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html"</li>
            <li>A local absolute path on your system -------> href="D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"   ||   href="file:///D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"</li>
            <p>So the base element interacts with the relative and kind of absolutes paths but not the absolute and local path. This means when a base is present we cant use a kind of
                absolute path as this will mess with the path but anytime else we can. We cannot use local paths whilst the website is live on a server.

        <summary>Emmet shortcuts</summary>
        <p>Emmet is an extension in vs code that has loads of shortcuts to speed up coding.</p>
        <p>When creating a new html file you can simply type "!" and then press tab to add all of the require boilerplate code for the webpage.</p>
        <p>When creating pretty much any element you can type the element without its angled brackets and press tab to create the element and set it up with its required attributes.</p>
        <p>When creating elements with the emmet shortcuts. You can type the elements ammet abbreviation and then add a "." which adds a class attribute to the element. Any words typed after will be the value of the class attribute. For example -> "p.content" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetClassExample.png">
        <p>This can be done for the id attribute as well with a "#". So typing the following -> "p#content2" creates the following:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetIdExample.png">
        <p>Typing these emmet abbreviations without an element beforehand emmet will defualt to creating a details element.</p>
        <p>to get more complex this can involve creating nested elements. Typing an element to be nested inside of an element uses ">". So creating a details inside of a details with the first details containing a class and the nested details containing an id would look like this: ".content>#id"</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetNestedExample.png">
        <p>To add multiple child elements you must use the "+" sign to add more nested elements inside the first. So -> ".content>#id+#id2" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetMultipleNestedExample.png">
        <p>Adding multiple of the same element can be done with the "*" symbol. So -> ".content>#id*3" creates: (This is mostly done with creating lots of list items)</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetMultipleSameNestedExample.png">
        <p>Lorem ipsum content can be created by typing "lorem" and then the nnumber of words you want. So -> "lorem20" creates:</p>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eveniet, repudiandae? Officiis distinctio sed quae quos itaque quis eveniet, mollitia neque.</p>
        <p>We can use parentheses to generate however many elements we want. So -> "(.content)*5" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/emmet/emmetParenthesesGeneration.png">
        <p>When typing html emmet can be used to wrap the contents of the webpage so they fit onto the screen. This stops the need for halving the contents of any lines to fit onto the screen. This is done with "alt+z"</p>

        <summary>css- inline,internal and external</summary>
        <p>Using css to style a website there are multiple ways of adding css to elements.</p>
        <p style="color: brown;">The first is inline. Inline styling is done inside of the element using the style attribute. This obviously only affects that singular element so is used when styling something alone. Here is an example:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/iie/inlineExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The second is internal. Internal sytling is done internally in a single webpage via a style element in the head element. This style element will hold styling for the whole page and specifies specific elements with associated styles. Here is an example:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/iie/internalExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The third is external. External styling uses styling that is not visible on the webpage. A simple link element will be used linking to a css file outside of the webpage and styling will take place that way. Here is an example of the link and css stlye sheet:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/iie/externalLinkExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/iie/externalCssExample.png" alt="">
        <p>Below shows a button with all methods of styling applying different colours to it. The browser prioritises inline first then internal and then external styling last. The inline styling is the one applied.</p>
        <button style="background-color: burlywood;">Button</button>

        <summary>Favicons</summary>
        <p>Adding favicons into the website seems to be hard. Alot of the information out there says having the favicon in the root directory of your website seems to be the way, however from doing it this way it doesnt seem to work. Additionaly having it in an images folder in your root directory should be the way. Basically ive tried them all and some of them seem to work now and again. However what stays the same is the link element that you use to show the browser where to get the favicon from. The code should look like this: (with the correct location)</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/favicons/faviconExample.png" alt="">
        <p>Supposedly adding it in the root directory should make the website use the same favicon throughout all the webpages however this does not seem to be the case for me.</p>

        <summary>Block and inline</summary>
        <p>Elements work differently. There are 2 types of elements that work differently from each other. Span and details elements are most notably different. Span is an inline element meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much space that is neccessary for its content. Whereas a details element is a block element always starts on a new line and browsers always add some space (a margin) before and after the element. It always takes up the full width of the screen(It stretches out to the left and right as far as possible).</p>
        <ul>Block Level Elements:</ul>

        <ul>Inline Elements:</ul>

        <p>The folowing shows the difference between the 2 types of elements with showing its border.</p>      
        <p style="border: 1px solid black">p</p>
        <span style="border: 1px solid black">span</span>

        <summary>Importance of class and id attributes</summary>

        <p id="classBookmark"></p>
        <h2>Class:</h2>
        <p>The class attribute is used to specify a class for a HTML element. Multiple elements can share this class. Being able to refer to an elements class is often used to point to a style sheet. Importantly the elements with this class can be reffered to to be accessed and manipulated. Below shows the class of a paragraph element reffering internally to a style sheet.</p>
        <p class="randomClassStyle"> random class style text.</p>
        <p>This is the code:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/classStyleExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/classParagraphExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The class attribute can be used on any html element. It is case sensitive. The syntax for class has to be with a period "." then a name and curly braces with css in.</p>
        <p>In javascript to get a class attribute the syntax is -> "document.getElementsByClassName("classname")"</p>

        <br> 
    
        
        <h2>Id:</h2>
        <p>The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an html element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an html document, unlike class attributes whihc can be used as much as you like. Id is unique and only used once.</p>
        <p>The id attribute is most commonly used to point to a specific style declaration in a stylesheet. It is also used by javascript to manipulate that specific element.</p>
        <p>The syntax for id is to write a hash character "#" followed by and id name. Then define the css properties within the curly braces.</p>
        <p id="randomIdStyle"> random id style text</p>
        <p>This is the code:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/idStyleExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/idParagraphExample.png" alt="">
        <p>The id name must contain one character, it cannot start with a number and must not contain whitespaces.</p>
        <p>A use of id which class doesnt use is the ability to add html bookmarks and link to them. These bookmarks are placed throughout long documents and then a user can link to that bookmark in order to jump to that specific position in the document. Below is a link which should take you to the start of the class section:</p>
        <a href="#classBookmark">jump to bookmark</a>
        <p>This is coded like this:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/bookmarkExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/classID/bookmarkExample2.png" alt="">
        <p>The id attributes is also used with javascript similarly to the class attribute where javascript can access elements with specific id's. This can then be handled and manipulated accordingly.</p>
        <p>The javascript syntax to get an id attribute is -> "document.getElementById("idname")"</p>

        <summary>Layout elements</summary>
        <p>Websites typically display content that is all grouped together in a certain way. Importantly the website has semantic elements that define different parts of the webpage.</p>
        <ul>header - defines a hjeader for a document or section</ul>
        <ul>nav - Defines a set of navigation links</ul>
        <ul>section - Defines a section in a document</ul>
        <ul>article - Defines an independant, self-contained content</ul>
        <ul>aside - Defines content aside from the content(like a sidebar)</ul>
        <ul>footer - Defines a footer for a document or a section</ul>
        <ul>details - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand</ul>
        <ul>summary - Defines a heading for the details element</ul>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/layout/layoutExample.png" alt="">
        <p>This layout is mostly for web1.0 when websites where strictly just about displaying content for the user. This has changed over the years as we developed into web2.0. Despite their being much easier methods of creating this layout in modern days i want to explore just a little about how it was traditionally. Easier methods today would typically incorporate some css framework to organise this layout like bootstrap however im going to cover some techniques that was used:</p>

        <h2>css float</h2>
        <p> It was very common to do entire web layouts using the css float property. This is easy to learn, and you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages for this technique are that floating elements are tied to document flow, which harms the flexibility. Below shows the difference in the two pages.</p>
        <a href="./0media/floatPage/float.html">Page styled with float!</a>
        <p>Most notably the footer and header has been increased in size and the article and nav parts inside of the section element have been aligned next to each other. The nav and article element have been aligned next to each other using the float element. This seems to work where they both have float left assigned to them and the first element on the page gets to be on the left.</p>

        <h2>css flexbox</h2>
        <p>Flexbox is a very commonly used technique and it ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accomodate different screen sizes and different display devices. The following shows the difference between the pages:</p>
        <a href="./0media/flexboxPage/flexbox.html">Page styled with flexbox!</a>
        <p>This seems to work where the section element sets up a container for the flexboxes and then the elements inside of the section element ie the nav and article are set up as flex boxes that appear to have some identification on the order they are presented.</p>

        <h2>css grid</h2>
        <p>This seems to work similarly to the table html element.</p>

        <summary>Responsive Web design</summary>
        <p>Responsive web design is an extremely important aspect of creating websites and webpages. Phones, tvs, computers, laptops and tablets all have varying screen sizes. This causes the elements of a webpage to show differently. It is very important for a website to be able to effectively show its content whilst making it look good taking into account varying screen sizes. Successful web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.</p>
        <p>HTML and CSS are used to automatically resize, shrink, hide or enlarge a website to make it look good on all devices.</p>
        <p>Setting the viewport of all your webpages should be done. This is actually added automatically with the "!" emmet shortcut to quickly set up a webpage. Thsi works by giving the browser instructions on how to control the pages dimensions and scaling. Here is an example of the code and what it does:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/viewportExample.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/withoutViewport.png" alt="">
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/withViewport.png" alt="">
        <p>You can also create responsive images that scale to the size of any device. This is done utilizing the width property set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale appropriately to the screen size. Change the size of your browser and see this take affect with the following image:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/scalableImage.png" style="width:100%;" alt="">
        <p>This is not the best solution as the image takes up the full width of the webpage. A better solution is using max-width to 100% and height to auto which uses the images original size and only downscales when it has to. This is shown in the following with the same image:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/scalableImage.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"alt="">
        <p>You can show different images depending on the browser width with the picture element. This is done in order to take into account different screen sizes. Resizing the browser should change the picture below:</p>
        <picture>
            <source srcset="./0media\images\lessonsLearned\responsiveWD\smallCactus.jpg" media="(max-width: 500px)">
            <source srcset="0media\images\lessonsLearned\responsiveWD\mediumCactus.jpg" media="(max-width: 1000px)">
            <source srcset="0media\images\lessonsLearned\responsiveWD\bigCactus.jpg" media="(max-width: 2000px)">
            <img src="./0media\images\lessonsLearned\responsiveWD\smallCactus.jpg" alt="" media="(max-width: 500px)">
        </picture>
        <p>This is kind of finnicky to get working correctly but from what ive gathered the max widths that you set should no more than the width of the actual image. In doing so allows the picture element to appropriately display the image. If not done correctly it will sometimes show the image you supplied in the image element. Youve got to play around with it quite abit in order to get it working and it seems to be the case where you add a max width much larger than the images. This is probably done much more accurately with javascript lol. This is the code that i got working:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/responsiveWD/changePictureCode.png" alt="">
        <p>Responsive text size can also be done much more easily than with images. This is set with a vw unit which means the viewport width. This way the text size can follow the size of the browser window. The code is -> style="font-size:10vw" This is used below:</p>
        <h3 style="font-size:3vw">Responsive text</h3>
        <p>Media queries are commonly used in responsive webpages. These are used to define different styles for different browser sizes. Resizing the browser for the following div elements (that are aligned to fit aligned next to each other.) will eventually set each div to take up 100% width. </p>
        <div class="left">
            <p>Left Menu</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main">
            <p>Main Content</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Right Content</p>
        </div>
        <p>Below we have the code to produce this:</p>

        <summary>Semantic elements</summary>
        <p>Semantic elements are elements that have meaning to the browser and the developer. Non-semantic elements tell nothing about its content.</p>
        <p>Form, table and article are semantic elements as they clearly describe what their use is on the webpage. Unlike div and span which dont describe its desired content.</p>
        <p>These semantic elements i think are mostly old html elements from when webpages were first built. Back when websites were still new most of their content would be readable and not interactive therefore they would typically hold semantic information and therefore these elements would be used all the time. Nowadays websites do so many different things and their content doesnt strictly classify into semantic content, hence why most websites nowadays are built wnot strictly following the semantic content design. A typical website holding semantic information is commonly dispplayed like the following:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/semantics/semanticFlow.png" alt="">
        <p>I have tried to create this webpage layout as simply as possible. This proved difficult as i have minimal experience setting the layout for a webpage as such. I initially tried using floats and got no where, then moved to using flexbox which i gathered wasnt the right method to create that specific layout. I eventually used css grid and it took me a while to get used to however i finally created the desired layout. Importantly i wanted this webpage to be as simple as possible and responsive so that it scales nice. Below you'll find a log of creating this webpage and a link to the webpage</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Log of creating this webpage</summary>
            <p>I got carried away with this responsive design quite abit and found that using percentage heights on all the elements allowed the whole page to scale down nicely.</p>
            <p>There were some elements that had issues as it got really small and simply setting the min-width and min-height stopped the element from scaling anymore. This actually caused issues were content would take up more than the percentage required at small screen sizes so i scrapped this. I started using vmax font sizes to allow content to fit into the smaller sized elements. I found the cut of where content would be hidden was at a width of 162 pixels. Only nav elements would cut off. This is fixed later with media queries.</p>
            <p>I got really carried away with ensuring the website only used 100% of the screen width and height at all times. In doing so means that no scroll bar ever becomes present because no content ever overflows or goes outside of the 100%. This commonly happens due to margin and padding however using calc() allowed me to take away the margins that were present against 100% which stopped elements overflowing and worked so that no scroll bar ever becomes present in the webpage.</p>
            <p>I used flexboxes inside most of the semantic elements to easily vertically and horizontally center text. Flexboxes are good at scaling down as well.</p>
            <p>I used responsive text scaling on all the elements so that text isnt too big on small screens. Using vmax seemed to be the best method.</p>
            <p>I also used media queries on the navbar as scaling this down causes nav elements to naturally dissapear. These media queries make the nav elements smaller and take up the full width of the screen. In order to implement this so nav links dont go missing on the website i need to change alot of the percentage heights in order to fit all the content all truly on 100% of the screen. In order to do this properly i would want it to scale dynamically to the amount of nav links with their different sizes.I think an acceptable thing to do here is to simply add another line that nav links can go on and accept any overflow of links after that. These are very extreme methods for such smaller screen sizes that wont occur for real life applications but for some reason i want to give it a go.</p>
            <p>The navbar element start to lose links at around 200px wide with a height of 650px. Im going to start the navbar transformation at 300px wide and 900px high as i have really small links. After completing this ive found that at certain screen sizes the second line added into the navbar isnt needed because the height causes the elements to be tiny anyways and we end up with an unneccesary line. Ive also found that at desktop screen sizes the text is really big and some overflow causes a scroll bar to appear. This was caused by vmax, i started using vmin instead.</p>
            <p>To fix the navbar issue i need to be able to set width and resolution in the media query. Currently all common phone screen sizes are not making use of this excess space created. As ive just changed elements to use vmin the links are small enough to fit onto one line. I have commented out a nested media query that can be used should the need ever arise to supply more space for links!</p>
            <p>The only thing that causes content to not fill up the whole screen is when we get to 100px width and content starts to squash up to the top of the page, however ive definitely achieved a more than acceptable responsive design.</p>

        <summary>Style guides</summary>
        <p>Coding practices and standards are neccessary when creating any program. This is the same within html.</p>
        <p>Aspects of coding html that must be maintained are:</p>
        <li>The document delcaration should always be -> <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/doctype.png" alt="Doctype code"></li>
        <li>Always use lowercase element names -> "body". Not "body"</li>
        <li>Its actually not neccessary to close all elements, however it is always good practice to close them.</li>
        <li>Always use lowercase attribute names -> "href". Not "HREF"</li>
        <li>Html attributes actually dont need to be quoted however it is best practice to do so. -> "class="container"". Not "class=container"</li>
        <li>Images must always specify alt, width and height. -> <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/images.png" alt="imageExample" style="width: 450px; height: 21px;"></li>
        <li>Html allows spaces around equal signs however it always best to make them spaceless. -> "href="/index"". Not "href = "/index"" </li>
        <li>Avoid long code lines. long code lines make the code unreadable:</li>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/longCodeLines.png" alt="">
        <li>Never skip the title element. This is required for search engines. This supplies content for the browser toolbar, the page when it is added to favourites and a title for search engines.</li>
        <li>It is always best practice to always add the html and body elements as these can actually not ommited with most browsers.</li>
        <li>In html empty html elements can actually be closed. It is usually best to close these elements with a "/" at the end.</li>
        <li>The lang attribute should always be added to a html tag. This automatically done using emmet shortcuts but make sure to add a country code after the language code. <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/langAttribute.png" alt=""></li>
        <li>Proper interpretation of and correct search engine indexing will require both the language and chartset encoding. These should be defined as early as possible in the document. This is done with the emmet shortcut.</li>
        <li>Setting the viewport is an important aspect for responsive design. It is good practice to add this to all webpages so they scale with the devices screen. <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/viewport.png" alt=""></li>
        <li>Html comments are written with "&lt;!-- --	&gt;" Long comments should indented with 2 spaces. Example:</li>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/longComments.png" alt="">
        <li>Simple syntax should be used for linking stylesheets.(This is where the type is not neccessary). <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/cssSyntax.png" alt=""></li>
        <li>When adding css make sure that quotes are only around values that contain spaces. Short and Long css should set up like the following:</li>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/shortCss.png" alt=""><img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/styleGuides/longCss.png" alt="">
        <li>Simple syntax should be used when loading external scripts. The type attribute is not neccessary. -> "&lt;script src="myscript.js"&gt;"</li>
        <li>Accessing html elements in javascript can result in errors if the html is done wrong.</li>
        <li>Use lowercase file names throughout the website. Some web servers are case sensitive about file names. This can cause problems with file names being spelt with upper cases. Make sure to always follow then first character should be lowercase and then any additional word after that starts with a capital for readability. Even small errors will break the website if you move from a case sensitive to insensitive server.</li>
        <li>File extensionsshould always have the ".html" (weirdly .htm is allowed). Css files should always have the ".css" extension and javascript should always have the ".js" extension.</li>
        <li>There is no difference between the ".htm" and the ".html" file extensions and they will noth be treated the same.</li>
        <li>When a url does not specify a filename at the end the server adds a default filename such as "index.html", "index.html", "default.html", "default.htm". Servers can be configured differently and if your server is configured with "index.html" as the default filename your file must be named "idex.html" and not "default.htm". SErvers can be configured with more than one default filenames.</li>

        <summary>Character entities, symbols and emojis!</summary>
        <p>The whole utf-8 character set has codes for all the characters you would want to display on a webpage. These characters can be used to display emojis, greek letters and just plain old alphabet characters.There are up to 10175 characters available in this character set that you can disp[lay with its unique entity or number code.</p>
        
        <h3>Entities</h3>
        <p>Html has reserved characters that can cause trouble if you want them to be in text. For example the crocadile brackets are commonly used for elements therefore cant be written plainly in text. This is where character entities come in. You can use either the entities number or its name to do this. These entities have specific codes that generate certain characters that a html page would use in its code. Character tags are used to display reserved characters in HTML. To write more than and less than signs "&lt;" and "&gt;" you write their codes in the text like ive done here:</p>

        <p>Non breaking spaces are commonly used to prevent the browser from truncating spaces in the page. Example:</p>
        <p>          10 Normal spaces before</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 non breaking spaces before</p>
        <p>Here we have some popular entity codes: 	&yen; 	&reg;</p>

        <p>Diacritical notes are also added to text using entity codes: O&#768; a&#770;</p>

        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <li>Mathematical Symbols: &nabla; &#8719; 	&#8721;</li>
        <img src="./0media/images/lessonsLearned/enititiesSymbolsCharset/symbols.png" alt="">
        <li>Greek Letters: 	&#915; 	&#916;</li>

        <h3>Emojis</h3>
        <p>The character set utf-8 hosts all of these entitiy codes. Emojis are also included. &#128512; &#128509; &#128511;</p>
