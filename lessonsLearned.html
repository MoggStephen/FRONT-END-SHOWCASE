        <summary>Navigating through website structure using href attribute</summary>

        <img src="0media/images/websiteStructure.png" style="height: 700px;">
        <p>As ive been coding my website ive been using the "./"" to navigate to my media folders to display images. This is a relative path. A relative path is one that starts from
            the current directory. For example the current directory of the audio.html file is "htmlElements\audioAndVideo". In order to get to the media folder 
            to display an image i would need to use the relative path "./media". This accesses the current relative directory to the "htmlElements\audioAndVideo" so that i can 
            access the media folder there. If i wanted to back a directory i would use "../" which would take me to the "htmlElements" directory.
        </p>
        <p>From here on out if i wanted to go back more than 1 directoriy the method to do this changes. To go back 2 directories which in this website takes us back to the root
            of the website the method to do this is "../../". From here on out adding one more "../" takes us one more directory back relatively. In this case doing "../../" does 
            take us to the root of the website however this is done relatively so it is not an absolute path.
        </p>
        <p>An absolute path always begins with "/" which accesses the root directory of the website. In the case of the website currently accessing the absolute path does 
            not work. This is because the website is not setup with a server and browsers dont know the root of the website as im simply opening the website via its html from
            its folder. In order to use an abosulte path and have it work i would need to run my website through a server which tells the browser what the root of the 
            website is. Using the absolute path in vs code brings up the root of the website however the browser doesnt know that and the browser takes us to root directory
            of the hard drive on my computer which is "file:///D:/". Running the website through a server should solve this.
        </p>
        <p>Ive just installed a live server extension which replicates a live environment for my website. Instead of simply opening my website through its html a live server and port is used.
            In doing so now the browser knows where the root directory of my website is and i can now use absolute paths. Additionally saving a page will automatically refresh
            the webpage open on my browser.

            <summary>Interaction between base element and relative and absolute paths.</summary>

            <p>As ive been updating my base element ive learnt some things. Supposedly the base element should only interact with relative paths however ive added what i thought was an 
                absolute path but the base element interacted with it. So ive learnt some things about the types of paths that there are:
            </p>
            <li>Relative paths -----------------------------> href="audio.html"   ||   href="./audio.html"   ||   href="../"   ||   href="../../" and so on</li>
            <li>A kind of absolute but still relative path -> href="/index.html"</li>
            <li>An absolute path ---------------------------> href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html"</li>
            <li>A local absolute path on your system -------> href="D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"   ||   href="file:///D:\Stephen\Documents\websiteProgression\index.html"</li>
            <p>So the base element interacts with the relative and kind of absolutes paths but not the absolute and local path. This means when a base is present we cant use a kind of
                absolute path as this will mess with the path but anytime else we can. We cannot use local paths whilst the website is live on a server.

        <summary>Emmet shortcuts</summary>
        <p>Emmet is an extension in vs code that has loads of shortcuts to speed up coding.</p>
        <p>When creating a new html file you can simply type "!" and then press tab to add all of the require boilerplate code for the webpage.</p>
        <p>When creating pretty much any element you can type the element without its angled brackets and press tab to create the element and set it up with its required attributes.</p>
        <p>When creating elements with the emmet shortcuts. You can type the elements ammet abbreviation and then add a "." which adds a class attribute to the element. Any words typed after will be the value of the class attribute. For example -> "p.content" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetClassExample.png">
        <p>This can be done for the id attribute as well with a "#". So typing the following -> "p#content2" creates the following:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetIdExample.png">
        <p>Typing these emmet abbreviations without an element beforehand emmet will defualt to creating a details element.</p>
        <p>to get more complex this can involve creating nested elements. Typing an element to be nested inside of an element uses ">". So creating a details inside of a details with the first details containing a class and the nested details containing an id would look like this: ".content>#id"</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetNestedExample.png">
        <p>To add multiple child elements you must use the "+" sign to add more nested elements inside the first. So -> ".content>#id+#id2" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetMultipleNestedExample.png">
        <p>Adding multiple of the same element can be done with the "*" symbol. So -> ".content>#id*3" creates: (This is mostly done with creating lots of list items)</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetMultipleSameNestedExample.png">
        <p>Lorem ipsum content can be created by typing "lorem" and then the nnumber of words you want. So -> "lorem20" creates:</p>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eveniet, repudiandae? Officiis distinctio sed quae quos itaque quis eveniet, mollitia neque.</p>
        <p>We can use parentheses to generate however many elements we want. So -> "(.content)*5" creates:</p>
        <img src="./0media/images/emmetParenthesesGeneration.png">
        <p>When typing html emmet can be used to wrap the contents of the webpage so they fit onto the screen. This stops the need for halving the contents of any lines to fit onto the screen. This is done with "alt+z"</p>

        <summary>Block and inline</summary>
        <p>Elements work differently. There are 2 types of elements that work differently from each other. Span and details elements are most notably different. Span is an inline element meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much space that is neccessary for its content. Whereas a details element is a block element always starts on a new line and browsers always add some space (a margin) before and after the element. It always takes up the full width of the screen(It stretches out to the left and right as far as possible). </p>
